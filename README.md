<strong>Welcome to my github profile</strong>

#### A Little About Me:
  <p style="text-align: center;">Hey there, Iâ€™m a JavaScript Rockstar, and currently, Iâ€™m working for Cisco on Webex Teams. I had 4+ years of professional experience working mostly on Web Development Stack. PHP was my god who welcomed me into the software world. From there I met my girlfriend which is highly weird and popular. Some people call it worst, some call it great, but I call it Javascript!</p>
<p> I spend my free time looking for open source js related projects and I try to work on those issues. You can see the below list of repos which I had worked on. </p>
<p>
I love Swimming, doing Workouts, and Travelling to new places (mostly alone). 
If you want to get in connection please check the top right icons as Iâ€™m available there (mostly on Twitter & LinkedIn)
</p>

<p>        Thank you for stopping by - Arjun Kesava (Rajinikanth)</p>
